Some information about me:

    I was employed at ISPE while I studied my BSc, where I designed and investigated the use of IoT devices with LoRa protocols in different systems. 

    During my studies I completed several internships. At embeX I was active in the development of Python scripts for automated processing. As a result 
    of my involvement in development and manufacturing processes, I was able to acquire very good analytical skills and the ability to apply them in context. 

    In April 2020, I started working as a technical employee at the company Sick AG in Reute in the field of Quality Management.

    I have been working as a software engineer in embedded systems at Newtec since June 2021.
